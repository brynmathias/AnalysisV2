Instructions to install the Higg Limit code and run :

(1) Setup Higgs limit code area:
> setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc5_amd64_gcc434 

> cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_8
> cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src 
> cmsenv
> cvs co  HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
> scramv1 b

(2)
Inside the directory : HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit/data/tutorials/
you should put the content of limitTools/
 
(3) Submit Jobs to lxplus:
> ./runLimit.sh 
[ Set MODE="OBS" or "EXP" 
and THRESHOLD="thrHT500" or "thrHT750 or "thrHT1000" ]

(4) 
> bjobs |grep "RUN" |wc -l
[ View how many jobs are in RUNNING state ]

(5) After jobs are completed:
Put the script "CLs_reader_snippet.sh" under mSUGRA_ObservedLimit_thrHTxxx
>./CLs_reader_snippet.sh    
[ this script will read the CLs value from each SUSY point output and will return a txt file with the m0 , m1/2 and CLs values ]

(6) Produce the ExclusionLimit plot: 
 If you want to produce the 2D exclusion plot yourslef as well , you can use the plotLimit.C macro . By editing this macro, you have to put the name of the txt file produced at (5) as an argument to the plotLimit function.
